# Lightweight RPC Mechanism for Math Operations

This project implements a simple RPC-style client–server system using Python sockets.  
The client sends requests like:

    add 5 3
    multiply 4 7

The server parses the request, performs the operation, and returns the result.

## Features
- Supports add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Simple text-based RPC protocol
- Socket communication
- Easy to extend

## How to Run

### 1. Start the Server
